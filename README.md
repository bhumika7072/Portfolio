What are the most important sections in a portfolio ?
There are many different ways of creating a portfolio.

How to create it depends on what type of professional you are, who you are building it for, and why you are creating it.
 1. Hero section.
      The hero section is the first thing people see when they enter your portfolio. It is displayed under your logo and menu. The hero section helps the reader
to understand what you offer, why someone should work with you, and the value that you provide with your.

2. About me section.
      Give the reader a short summary about yourself. Include subjects such as your education, work experience, projects and interests. Help the reader to
understand what you are passionate about and your superpowers (the things that you are really good at). Remember to keep it short and simple.

3. Projects section.
      List the projects that you have worked on. The most used way is to order the list by date, but in some cases it can make sense to order them in another
logical way. Add details to each project, which includes your role, what you did, and, how the project turned out. Adding pictures to showcase what you built 
is a plus! Showcase the things that you are proud of.

4. Contact me section.
      Let the reader know how and where they can get in touch with you.  Add your contact details and other contact channels such as your GitHub profile,
LinkedIn, Youtube and so on.
